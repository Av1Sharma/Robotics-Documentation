## About This Documentation

This documentation is designed to help team members understand our robot's programming architecture and development practices. We use WPILib's Java framework for our robot code, and this documentation includes examples and explanations of key concepts.

## Example Repository

Throughout this documentation, we reference code examples from our [Example Robot Code Repository](https://github.com/COMETRobotics/example-robot-code). This repository contains a complete, working example of our robot code structure and demonstrates best practices for FRC programming.
